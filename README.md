### 💼 Summary

Tech-leaning post-sales operator. I bridge **sales promises** with **live deployments**. 250+ enterprise implementations, $500K+ ARR influenced, 95% client retention. I work behind the scenes integrating **WhatsApp**, **CRMs**, and automation stacks — mostly in **LATAM** and remote-first environments.
